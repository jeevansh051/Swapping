# Swapping
A basic cpp code while describing swapping

## Theory:
- Swapping numbers is the process of interchanging their values. In this article, we will learn algorithms and code to swap two numbers in the C++ programming language.
- Types of swappong metthods:
- 1. Swap Numbers Using a Temporary Variable:
     We can swap the values of the given two numbers by using another variable to temporarily store the value as we swap the variablesâ€™ data. The below algorithm shows how to use the 
     temporary variable to swap values.
     
- 2. Swap Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable:
We can also swap numbers without using the temporary variable. Unlike the previous method, we use some mathematical operations to swap the values.

- 3. Swap Two Numbers Using Inbuilt Function:
C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides an inbuilt swap() function to swap two numbers.
- syntax:
```
swap(a, b);
```

### outcomes:
This code does swapping of numbers which will help us.
